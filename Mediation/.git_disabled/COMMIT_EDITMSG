Fix: Add conditional package references for multi-targeting support

- Add conditional Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions versions:
  - net6.0/net7.0: version 7.0.0
  - net8.0: version 8.0.2
  - net9.0/net10.0: version 9.0.7
- This resolves NU1903 warnings about unsupported frameworks
